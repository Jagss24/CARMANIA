# CARMANIA
This is my first HTML PROJECT EVER. This website shows us cars and if you wanna buy you can buy them. This project is simply for knowledge purpose and not for implementation.
I've also used Inline CSS for text-algin,font-size,font-famliy,etc.

In this project there are three options available 
1. Home:- That directs to home page.
2. About :- It tells us about the homepage(no implementation lorem has been used in about) and it also direct back to homepage.
3. Contact us :- It tells the user to fill their details if they want to be get in contact with us.It also direct back to homepage.

After that brand new cars will show in homepage.
Followed by 3 car models with description(lorem has been used in description) wiht a option of buying.
At last a link to get back at the top of the page.
